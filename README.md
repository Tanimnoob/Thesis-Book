Aquaculture, especially Mud Crab cultivation, is vital for meeting seafood demand; analyzing growth
dynamics and predicting prices is essential for sustainability and economic viability. The primary
objective of this research paper is to analyze the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
prices and to model the growth dynamics of Mud Crab (Scylla Olivacea). We employ identical models to
independently predict both crab growth and pricing. Our thorough evaluation of seven regression models
reveals that three outperform the rest, demonstrating superior performance. Further scrutiny based on
mean cross-validation RMSE values highlights the exceptional performance of our proposed Ensemble
Model combining the Linear Regression and Bayesian Ridge Regression models. The proposed ensemble
model excels with perfect fitting (0.00 MAE, MSE, RMSE, RMSLE, MAPE, and R2 of 1.00). To enable
real-time predictions for crab growth and price, a web interface is also implemented which utilizes our
proposed model.
